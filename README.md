# Junior's Open Smash Bats
Open Smash Bats is an open-source port and continuation of Tsuteto's Smash Bats mod from 1.7.10 to 1.12.2.

## What does this mod add?
Why, baseball bats of course! Should be nine if I can count correctly. There are two main categories of baseball bats.

### Standard type bats

- Blast Smash Bat <img src="https://i.ibb.co/FCk714b/giant-blast-smash-bat.png" alt="In-game art of the Blast Smash Bat" width="16"/>
- Creeper Smash Bat <img src="https://i.ibb.co/Gv2Bfbns/giant-creeper-smash-bat.png" alt="In-game art of the Creeper Smash Bat" width="16"/>
- Riding Smash Bat <img src="https://i.ibb.co/5gsxR3q4/giant-riding-smash-bat.png" alt="In-game art of the Riding Smash Bat" width="16"/>
- Thunder Smash Bat <img src="https://i.ibb.co/vxyZ1L0G/giant-thunder-smash-bat.png" alt="In-game art of the Thunder Smash Bat" width="16"/>

## What's the difference between standard and special type bats?
While standard type bats simply punch the player away, and differently strong depending on the material, special type bats focus on special abilities. For example, the Blast Smash Bat creates an explosion on punch, launching the mob (or your friends!) far away, while the Riding Smash Bat allows you to travel ON the mob you just launched away. Try them out ingame and see for yourself, it's a ton of fun playing around with the different abilities.

## But Nino/JuniorWMG/[Insert other Pseudonym here], GuteeMon already ported the mod to 1.12!
Yes, you're correct - they did! But there are three main reasons why I made this port myself.
1. Their mod is not open source.
2. It's Curse only and I want to be able to use it in Modrinth packs
   <br>*ahem* TrollMods coming soon to Modrinth *[hopefully](https://gist.github.com/JuniorWolfgamingDE/9421aa513b17941b8eefca6204416fdf)*
3. It was a ton of fun to explore how to make 1.12.2 mods!
